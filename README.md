# Workout Catalogue React App

This is a simple workout catalogue React app that allows users to view a list of workouts, search for specific workouts, and view details about each workout.

### Searching for Workouts

To search for a specific workout, enter the name of the workout into the search field at the top of the page and click "Search". The list of workouts will be filtered to only show workouts that match the search term.
